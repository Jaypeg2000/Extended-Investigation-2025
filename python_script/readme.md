# Python script for EI project

This script is a simple multifunction script that uses VADER sentiment analysis, PANDA and other python libraries in order to scrape data using the YouTube API. Thanks to MIT, Python and Stackoverflow. This script uses python 3. The Google API client requires a personal developer key available from google, so make sure to edit the script to include both your key and the channel ID.

## Dependencies 

This script requires the following libraries: Pandas, Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK), Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) (Fully open source under the MIT licence), Youtube Transcript API and Google API Client. 

## VADER Lexicon text

I have included a stable local version of the VADER lexicon text that was used in the study. This is for archival purposes, incase the developers change their reference library in the future.
